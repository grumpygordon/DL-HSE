This repository contains my solutions to homeworks from my Deep Learning course at HSE University. 
Each homework was about choosing and training a model **from scratch** for a specific task on a given dataset and using only given libraries (mostly pytorch).
Solutions were ran in yandex datasphere using one V100 GPU in some reasonable time (around 8 hours each).

Each homework folder contains python notebook and a report in russian, though it is not required to understand notebook content.

I was solving 3 tasks: image classification to 200 classes via resnet34 (accuracy), machine translation from english to german via pytorch transformer (BLEU), image translation via pix2pix GAN (FID).
